# User Management System

This is a sample project demonstrating a User Management System with CRUD operations. The project is divided into two parts: a React.js frontend for the user interface and a Spring Boot backend for handling server-side logic.

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete users.
- Interactive user interface with React.js.
- Secure communication with the Spring Boot backend.
- RESTful API design.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - React Router for navigation
  - Axios for making HTTP requests

- **Backend:**
  - Spring Boot
  - Spring Data JPA for database interaction
  - MySQL Database for simplicity (can be replaced with other databases)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm for the frontend.
- Java and Maven for the backend.

## Setup

### Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   
  Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

  Run the frontend application:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
Open the frontend application in your browser.
Use the application to perform CRUD operations on users.
